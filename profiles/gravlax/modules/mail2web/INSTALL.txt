*Installation instructions:*

#  Enable and configure messaging, notifications, and mailhandler modules.
  - http://drupal.org/project/messaging
  - http://drupal.org/project/notifications
  - http://drupal.org/project/mailhandler
#  Setup a mailbox for mailhandler which you'll use with mail2web.
#  Enable the mail2web module
#  Go to admin/messaging/mail2web and configure as desired.

That's it.  Now, when notifications are sent out, they should appear with the delimiter text.
The default delimiter text says "((( Reply ABOVE this LINE to POST a COMMENT )))".


*Keep in mind:*

#  If a user does not have 'post comments' privilege, they will not be able to use mail2web.  The notifications
that get sent to users without 'post comments' privilege will not contain the necessary information from mail2web
in order for the user to reply via email.


*For developers*

# If you need to modify or maintain node parameters upon each reply, there is a hook_mail2web_alter that allows plugin
modules to act on the node object of each message that comes in via mail2web.


*Known issues*

#  If you get blank or incomplete messages, try turning off the "Message cleaner" on the mail2web settings page.  There is a regex
that works most of the time, but may not work all the time.  This can lead to incomplete or lost messages.  If you turn the message
cleaner off, all comments that are posted via mail2web will contain an email client byline at the bottom, like:
